##Experience

**Key Accounts Development Manager**, Venture Research, *2007 - Current*

c#, sql-server, jquery, node.js, mysql, sqlite, asp.net, javascript, html, css, linux, windows, winforms, asp.net-mvc, rfid, tfs, tfsbuild, user-interface, uml, diagram, entity-relationship, linq, entity-framework, gulp, knockout.js, cordova, gruntjs, sublimetext3

A premier system integration and development firm specializing in all facets of technology for supply chain management, material handling equipment, infrastructure components, wireless technology, and state of the art software and hardware development.  Specializing in complete end-to-end solutions including material handling equipment, RFID systems, software development, training and support.

##Achievements
* Designed and implemented a flexible and open database schema to consolidate 4 different schemas that were currently in use.  This became the basis for new projects.  This schema was expanded over 5 years to accommodate new requirements including transaction processing, asset management, and a new report generation system.  The schema was originally developed for SQL Server but was eventually ported to Oracle and SQLite.
* Designed and implemented a data abstraction layer to sit on top of the new database schema.  This allowed the developers to interact with the data using a POCO-based ORM API.  As the database was moved from SQL Server 2005 through SQL Server 2012 and was ported to SQL Server CE, the abstraction layer remained the same.  This allowed the code to be easily ported to other platforms including Mono and the .Net Compact Framework.
* Architected a backend processing engine that utilized a plug-in model to adapt to a variety of situations.  The plug-in model allowed for a clean separation between the engine and the business process.  Personally wrote engine and key plug-ins including transaction processing and alerting.

##Key Accounts Development Manager
* Systems architect including database design, boundary data exchange, system integration, and object modeling.  Includes developing UI designs, ER diagrams, UML models, data flow diagrams, and logic flow charts.
* Responsible for writing key software components including the data access layer, user authentication, reporting engine, and transaction execution engine.  
* Managed a team of developers to produce quality solutions for embedded Linux, Android, Windows, and the Web.  
* Worked closely with tier 1 accounts to document software requirements, negotiate pricing, coordinate intercompany activities, and to manage development projects.
* Wrote detail user guides, task-specific user guides, and performed user training.  Training methods included remote, in-person, and hands-on.
* Reported directly to the company president.
* Development platforms included .Net, Android, and Mono.  Often integrating embedded, web, and traditional server hardware environments.
* As a technical member of a growing company, I took on the role of a network administrator. I built servers using Windows and Linux for such tasks as file sharing, backup, email, web servers, and TFS.
* Performance monitoring and tuning using tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, SQL Profiler, and Windows Performance Monitor.
